# CWStatusBarNotification

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cezarywojcik/CWStatusBarNotification.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cezarywojcik/CWStatusBarNotification)

**NOTE:** You can find a **Swift 2.0** implementation of this library [in the swift branch of this repo](https://github.com/cezarywojcik/CWStatusBarNotification/tree/swift). 

`CWStatusBarNotification` is a library that allows you to easily create text-based notifications that appear on the status bar.

You can find the documentation [here](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/CWStatusBarNotification/).

## Requirements

`CWStatusBarNotification` uses ARC and requires iOS 7.0+.

Works for iPhone and iPad.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

`pod 'CWStatusBarNotification', '~> 2.3.5'`

### Manual

Copy the folder `CWStatusBarNotification` to your project.

## Usage

Firstly, you need the following import statement:

```objc
#import "CWStatusBarNotification.h"
```

Now, you need to create a `CWStatusBarNotification` object. It is recommended that you do so by attaching it as a property to a `UIViewController`.

```objc
CWStatusBarNotification *notification = [CWStatusBarNotification new];
```

After you have a `CWStatusBarNotification` object, you can simply call the `displayNotificationMessage:forDuration:` method:

```objc
[self.notification displayNotificationWithMessage:@"Hello, World!"
                   forDuration:1.0f];
```

If you prefer to manually choose when to display and dismiss the notification, you can do so as well:

```objc
[self.notification displayNotificationWithMessage:@"Hello" completion:nil];
// wait until you need to dismiss
[self.notification dismissNotification];
```

### Behavior on Tap

The default behavior when the notification is tapped is to dismiss it. However, you can override this behavior by setting the `onTapNotification` block to something different. 

For example:

```objc
self.notification.notificationTappedBlock = ^(void) {
    NSLog(@"notification tapped");
    // more code here
};
```

Note that overriding this block means that the notification will no longer be dismissed when tapped. If you want the notification to still dismiss when tapped, make sure to implement the following when overriding the block:

```objc
__weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
self.notification.notificationTappedBlock = ^(void) {
    if (!weakSelf.notificationIsDismissing) {
        [weakSelf dismissNotification];
        // more code here
    }
};
```

## Customizing Appearance

First of all, you can customize the background color and text color using the following properties: `notificationLabelBackgroundColor` and `notificationLabelTextColor`.

Example:

```objc
notification.notificationLabelBackgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
notification.notificationLabelTextColor = [UIColor greenColor];
```

![custom colors](screenshots/ss1.gif)

The default value of `notificationLabelBackgroundColor` is `[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate].window.tintColor`.

The default value of `notification.notificationLabelTextColor` is `[UIColor whiteColor]`.

Finally, you can also choose from two styles - a notification the size of the status bar, or a notification the size of the status bar and a navigation bar. Simply change the `notificationStyle` property of the `CWStatusBarNotification` object to either `CWNotificationStyleStatusBarNotification` or `CWNotificationStyleNavigationBarNotification`.

![custom style](screenshots/ss2.gif)

The default value of `notificationStyle` is `CWNotificationStyleStatusBarNotification`.

## Customizing Animation

There are two properties that determine the animation style of the notification: `notificationAnimationInStyle` and `notificationAnimationOutStyle`. Each can take on one of four values:

* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleTop`
* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleBottom`
* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleLeft`
* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleRight`

The `notificationAnimationInStyle` describes where the notification comes from, whereas the `notificationAnimationOutStyle` describes where the notification will go.

The default value for `notificationAnimationInStyle` is `CWNotificationAnimationStyleTop`.

The default value for `notificationAnimationOutStyle` is `CWNotificationAnimationStyleTop`.

## Presenting a Custom View

As of version `2.2.0`, you can choose to present a custom view in lieu of presenting a simple message. The demo project shows a simple way in which you can make a custom NIB file and present it as the notification view using the `displayNotificationWithView:forDuration:` method:

```objc
UIView *view = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"CustomView" owner:nil options:nil][0];
[self.notification displayNotificationWithView:view forDuration:self.sliderDuration.value];
```
   
You can also display the notification and choose when to dismiss it as usual:

```objc
[self.notification displayNotificationWithView:view completion:nil];
// wait until you need to dismiss
[self.notification dismissNotification];
```


### Additional Remarks

The notifications will work in both screen orientations, however, screen rotation while a notification is displayed is not yet fully supported.
